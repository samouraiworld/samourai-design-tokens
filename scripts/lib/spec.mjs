// The values the design system fixes that tokens.json v0.1 does not carry as
// tokens, and the derivations that turn them into colours.
//
// They live here rather than inside scripts/build.mjs because two things read
// them: the build, which emits them, and the contrast gate, which measures
// them. A geometry the build owns privately is a geometry the gate cannot
// check — and a focus ring the gate cannot check is how a 1.78:1 halo ships
// under a label describing a ring that is not there. ADR-0002 records that,
// and the rule it sets: every colour composed from a constant here is measured
// by a row in contrast-pairs.json, through the `spec:` references below.
//
// Each constant is still anchored to tokens.json — the colours are token
// paths, never hexes — so a palette change flows through and a token rename
// fails the build and the gate rather than the browser.

  // a keyboard user has to locate themselves with. The ring is two-tone: an
  // opaque core, with the delivered halo kept at its 3 px width, pushed outside
  // the core.
  //
  // The core FOLLOWS `[data-theme]`. A single ring value cannot clear 3:1 on
  // every ground this package ships: the cobalt the ring was first built from
  // measures below 3:1 on all eight shell grounds of the dark theme, on five of
  // the black theme's eight, and on two of the light theme's own — its two
  // inverse panels. So each variant below names a THEME ROLE rather than one
  // token, and the core is resolved once per theme:
  //

  //                  hairline, muted, muted-2, and the painted status and tag

  //   `on-inverse`   controls on an inverse panel, where the normal core is the
  //                  wrong side of the ground. Core: the theme's `on-inverse`.
